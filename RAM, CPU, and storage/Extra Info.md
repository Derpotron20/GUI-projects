# RAM-and-CPU-reader
It reads your ram, cpu and storage and tells you information about them


To be able to use the code you need to install tkinter, customtkinter and psutil.

I decided to use customtkinter mostly for it's wider range of viewing options and it's ability to look more modern, however I did not use thi much,
if you would like to change the code to make it look more modern, go for it.

I used tkinter because there was a part in my code that I wasn't able to figure out how to do with customtkinter,
if you find a solution to fix it, please let me know so that I can make my code simpler.

I used psutil because it has access to CPU, RAM, and the storgae of a wide variety of laptops. The friend that I was making this for
did ask for it to show GPU, however I didn't have enough knowledge to understand what GPU was nor how to access it to use it in
this code, once again if you understand what it is and how to access it's information using python, please let me know.

Thank you for using this code, I worked on it over a week after learning about how to use tkinter, and it was a fun project to work on,
i'm thinking about making a video tutorial as well for how to make it, if you would like to see this happen, please let me know.
