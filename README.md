# GUI-projects
 My GUI projects that I made using tkinter mostly


There are a couple of different ones, but these GUI projects were all made using tkinter and/or customtkinter.

In here I've got an activity monitor, temperature and time converter, but if you can think of more things that I could make
using tkinter, please tell me and I'll see if I can do it. All such projects will be uploaded onto this GitHub page for
anyone to read and copy

Have fun
