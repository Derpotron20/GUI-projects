In this folder I have provided code that allows you to create character and monster info
in a GUI.

If you find a better way to format the different players and monsters, please tell me
so that I can add it here for a better experience for everyone.

Just be aware that it does create and store a file called "savefile.txt", if
you don't want this to happen just find the code that does it and you'll be
able to still use the code, however you will no longer be able to store the
info as soon as you quit.

Right at the start of the history, the initial commit includes the
code without all GUI factors, but it can't be used in things like VS Code, so it
works best with IDLE.
