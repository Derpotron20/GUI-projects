# GUI-projects
 My GUI projects that I made using tkinter mostly


In this folder there a couple of converters, for the temperature converter it only works with farenheit and celsius,
going both ways, however if you want me to I could add kelvin to it.

For the time converter, it doesn't return decimal places, instead it returns the amount of bigger units and then the
remainder of the smaller units that it was converting from.

The arrow image used for the time converter does make it a bit more annoying to load up, but I believe it makes it look
better, if you would like to replace it with a label to make it easier to use, go for it.

If you want to change any of these up, go for it. I was also thinking of making a video on how to make these.

Have fun
